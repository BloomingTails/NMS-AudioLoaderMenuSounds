# No Man's Sky's menu sounds for Audio Loader

Do you like **No Man's Sky?** Wish you could add a little **NMS** touch to your **Steam Deck**? This is exactly what this is!

This project customizes your **Steam Deck** with the **No Man's Sky** menu sounds. It uses the **Audio Loader** plugin to load and apply the sound effects.

You shouldn't download anything from this GitHub repositery unless you know exactly what you are doing, its main function is to serve as a holder for the **Audio Loader** theme browser. So if you want to install it easily, go on your **Steam Deck** with **Decky Loader** installed, get the [Audio Loader](https://github.com/DeckThemes/SDH-AudioLoader) plugin and from the **Audio Loader** browser search for **No Man's Sky**, you should find it!

You do not have **Decky Loader** on your **Steam Deck**? Check out [Decky Loader website](https://wiki.deckbrew.xyz/) to get started!
